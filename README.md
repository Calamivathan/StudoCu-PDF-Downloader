## Please Be Kind

We're a small passion project running on a lightweight server, funded entirely out of our own pocket. The backend does some heavy processing for each document, so please:

- **Don't spam requests** — be realistic and let everyone get their chance
- **Be patient** — downloads might take a little time, especially during peak hours. Just wait, it will come through
- **Don't waste server resources** — every unnecessary request takes away from someone else

We're doing our best to keep this running and will continue investing to make it better for you.
